# Discord Voice Recorder

A [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) script which can record voice calls. Summon the bot to a voice channel, and voil√†! the audio is piped right into your local machine.

Jump to [Installation & Usage](https://github.com/chebro/discord-voice-recorder#installation-and-usage) to get started.

_Recording voice calls without prior consent violates privacy. Do not use this bot without approval. I'm not responsible for your insanity._

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository : 
```
git clone https://github.com/chebro/discord-voice-recorder/
```

[Create a discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html). Invite the bot to your server, then:

1. Create a `config.json` file and a `recordings` folder at the root folder.
2. Paste the bot token (from [developer window](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) and any bot prefix into `config.json`, like so:

```yaml
{
    "BOT_TOKEN": "<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>",
    "PREFIX": "<BOT_PREFIX>"
}
```

You can run the bot in any one of the following two ways.

### Running the Script Locally

Run `npm i` to download necessary `node_modules`, then run `npm start`, the bot should be online.

### Run as a Docker Container

1. Build the docker image 

```
docker build -t dvr .
```

2. Bind `/recordings` directory on host to container and start the container with a custom name.

```
docker run \          
  --name <CONTAINER_NAME> \     
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/recordings,target=/usr/src/bot/recordings \
  dvr
```

The bot should be online. 

3. To stop the container, run `docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME>`, you can restart it using `docker start <CONTINAER_NAME>`.

### Bot Commands

1. Start Recording : `<PREFIX>enter <VOICE_CHANNEL_NAME>`

2. Stop Recording  : `<PREFIX>exit`

## Managing the Output

The output for each piece of audio stream is written to a unique file in [PCM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) (48000 Hz, signed 16-bit little-endian, 2 channel [stereo]) and saved to the `/recordings` directory.

### Merge Recording

To merge all output files to `/recordings/merge.pcm`, run:

```
node /bin/merge.js
``` 

**Note:** Empty your `recordings` folder (and remove `merge.pcm`) after each session. Running `./bin/merge.js` otherwise, will dump large merge files.

### Convert the Merged File to MP3

Head over to [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and download executables for your OS; If you're on Windows, double-check if the FFmpeg bin is on your path. As discussed in issue [#3](https://github.com/chebro/discord-voice-recorder/issues/3), to convert pcm to mp3, run:

```
ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 -i merge.pcm output.mp3
```
